# CVX: Copula View and Explore

The goal of this package is to provide somewhat of a more visual
introduction to the world of copulas.

An n-dimensional joint random variable distribution is
determined by (n + 1) probability models. First, you need
to know the n individual marginal distributions, one for each
component of the model. That tells you exactly how each 
random variable behaves in isolation from the others.

The (n+1)'th probability model needed is called the copula 
of the joint distribution.
